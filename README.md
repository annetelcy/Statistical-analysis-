This project inputs three numbers then it calculates the min, max, range , median, and average. 
My introduction to JavaScript came with its set of challenges, especially when I had to grapple with arrays. The primary tasks involved mathematical operations such as finding the median, maximum and minimum values, and calculating the range. While some tasks were straightforward, deriving the average and median proved complex.

Challenges Faced:

Connecting JavaScript to HTML: Initially, I struggled to link my JavaScript file with the HTML, but I eventually established the connection.
Mathematical Operations: Basic calculations like finding the maximum and minimum values were straightforward. However, tasks like computing the average and median were more intricate. To find the median, I experimented with various methods, arrays, and conditional loops.
Resource Utilization: Zybooks, though informative, had lengthy sections that made it challenging to focus. To supplement, I turned to external resources like YouTube, W3Schools, and the Bootstrap website. These platforms were instrumental in clarifying complex concepts and guiding my project completion.
Improvements and Learnings:

In hindsight, I'd enhance the project's visual appeal by improving the template and presenting the results more aesthetically. Despite the hurdles, this project enriched my understanding of JavaScript and introduced me to Bootstrap intricacies.
